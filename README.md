# FaceRec
Face Recognition System to be implemented in IIT Bhilai

## Description 
In our institute recently everywhere we go the guards are asking for ID. Instead of this, we can have a face recognition system placed at the hostel and acad entrance to keep a track of all people coming in. If an unauthorised person enters it should give some notification. Apart from this we can do some analytics like keep track of which person enters which place and how frequently. We can also try to detect the objects he is carrying and notify if anything is suspicious. This will provide our institute with its own security surveillance system

## Current Plan
1. Setup(Find ML models for face recognition and get them running) (Ongoing)
2. Modifying the model to meet our requirements
3. Decide the architecture of our system
4. Setup the architecture locally and get it working
5. Deploy the system
